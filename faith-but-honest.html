      <p>
        Faith, for me, has never been a neat little sentence with a bow on it.
        People love certainty because it feels like control. And humans love control the way toddlers love scissors.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe in God. That part is simple. What isn’t simple is the way people act like belief requires pretending
        you never have questions. Like questions are betrayal. Like curiosity is a crime scene.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve learned that some of the loudest “faith” is actually fear. Fear of being wrong. Fear of being judged.
        Fear of having to admit you don’t know. But not knowing is normal. It’s human. It’s honest.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t reject scripture. I reject the way people use it like a weapon or a remote control.
        I reject the version of God that needs you small, quiet, and obedient so someone else can stay powerful.
      </p>

      <p>
        If God is real, then truth can survive my questions. If God is real, the universe isn’t fragile.
        If God is real, I don’t have to lie to fit in.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think God shows up in patterns. In timing. In the way life keeps offering lessons I didn’t request.
        In the way healing doesn’t happen in a straight line, but it happens anyway.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some days my faith looks like prayer. Some days it looks like sitting in silence and admitting I’m tired.
        Some days it looks like choosing integrity when no one would notice if I didn’t.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t need certainty to keep walking. I need honesty. I need humility. I need a God big enough to handle me as I am,
        not as a performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        If faith is real, it should make you softer with people, not harder. It should make you braver, not meaner.
        It should make you more truthful, not more fake.
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s the version I’m keeping.
