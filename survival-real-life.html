        Survival is not a quote. It’s not a cute caption. It doesn’t fit neatly on a candle or a t-shirt,
        and if it did, you’d still be too tired to appreciate it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Survival looks like doing the dishes because the sink is starting to feel like a threat.
        It looks like showing up when your brain is begging you to disappear.
        It looks like making appointments you don’t want to make, and keeping them anyway.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s the small stuff. The boring stuff. The stuff nobody claps for.
        People love the highlight reel. They love the “after.” They don’t love the middle.
        The middle is where you’re still bleeding, just quieter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Survival looks like laughing at something stupid because it’s the first time you’ve laughed all week
        and you don’t want to scare it off.
      </p>

      <p>
        It looks like boundaries. Real ones. Not the kind you post about, the kind you enforce.
        The kind that costs you relationships you used to beg to keep.
      </p>

      <p>
        It looks like learning your own patterns. Your own triggers. Your own tells.
        It looks like pausing before you react. Not because you suddenly became calm and enlightened,
        but because you got tired of cleaning up the mess after.
      </p>

      <p>
        Survival looks like choosing the next right thing when everything in you wants to burn it down.
        Sometimes “the next right thing” is a shower.
        Sometimes it’s walking away.
        Sometimes it’s asking for help without apologizing for needing it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Survival is honest. It’s not pretty. It’s not consistent. It doesn’t always look like progress.
        But it is.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re in the middle, you’re not failing. You’re just living in the part people don’t romanticize.
        And you’re still here.
