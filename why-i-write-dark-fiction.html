      <p>
        People ask why I write dark fiction like I’m secretly get off on it.
        I get it. Humans love putting things into tidy boxes.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t write dark stories because I love darkness.
        I write them because I love what people do inside it.
        What they become. What they hide. What they admit when nobody is watching.
      </p>

      <p>
        Darkness is honest. It strips the performances off.
        In the dark, you can’t pretend you’re fine just because you’re smiling.
        In the dark, your choices matter more than your image.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dark fiction is where I can explore the things people avoid saying out loud.
        The power games. The fear. The obsession. The grief.
        The way love can be a rescue or a trap depending on who’s holding it.
      </p>

      <p>
        It also gives me room to tell the truth without pointing at real people.
        Fiction is a mask that lets you speak clearly.
        It’s a safe place to examine sharp things.
      </p>

      <p>
        And I like characters who aren’t polished.
        I like the ones who screw up.
        The ones who make choices they regret.
        The ones who keep going anyway.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes the point of a dark story is not to scare you.
        It’s to remind you you’re not alone in the parts of yourself you don’t brag about.
      </p>

      <p>
        I write dark fiction because it’s honest.
        And because honesty is the only thing that ever changed me.
