      <p>
Brandy Garland is an author of dark fiction and emotionally driven stories that explore power, love, memory, and the consequences of wanting more than the world allows. Her work blends psychological tension with intimate character studies, often focusing on flawed women, dangerous connections, and the quiet moments where everything changes.
</p>

<p>
She writes across genres including dark romance, psychological suspense, and speculative fantasy, with a style that favors restraint, intensity, and emotional truth over spectacle. Her stories are known for their slow-burn tension, morally gray characters, and endings that linger.
</p>

<p>
When she isn’t writing, Brandy works as a recovery coach and educator, a background that deeply influences her understanding of human behavior, resilience, and choice. She lives in Michigan and writes late at night, usually when she should be doing something more responsible.
